    >
    <p>The <b>Silkie</b> (also known as the <b>Silky</b> or <b> Chinese silk chicken</b>) is a breed of chicken
         named for its atypically fluffy plumage, which is said to feel like silk and satin. 
         The breed has several other unusual qualities, such as black skin and bones, blue earlobes, 
         and five toes on each foot, whereas most chickens only have four. They are often exhibited in 
         poultry shows, and appear in various colors. In addition to their distinctive physical 
         characteristics, Silkies are well known for their calm, friendly temperament. It is 
         among the most docile of poultry. Hens are also exceptionally broody, and care for young well. 
         Though they are fair layers themselves, laying only about three eggs a week, they are 
         commonly used to hatch eggs from other breeds and bird species due to their broody nature.</p>

         >
         <p>The <b>Plymouth Rock</b>  is an American breed of domestic chicken. It was first seen
            in Massachusetts in the nineteenth century, and for much of the early twentieth 
            century was the most popular chicken breed in the United States. It is a dual-purpose
            breed, raised both for its meat and for its brown eggs. It is resistant to cold,
            easy to manage, and a good sitter.</p>

         >
         <p>The <b>Orpington</b> is a British breed of chicken. It was bred in the late nineteenth century 
             by William Cook of Orpington, Kent in south-east England. It was intended to be a 
             dual-purpose breed, to be reared both for eggs and for meat, but soon became exclusively
              a show bird.</p>
